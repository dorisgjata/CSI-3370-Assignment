# H1 CSI-3370-Assignment
This is a repo to demonstrate the ability to understand and use GIT for managing our CSI-3370 project codebase.  

The goal of our project is to create a dining web application to be used by the campus community, where they can customize their own daily menu and receive recommendations.
